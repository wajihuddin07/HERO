This Java repository is a simple object-oriented project focused on modeling a set of superheroes using interfaces and class implementations. The main folder contains core project files including:

Interface.java – Defines the common interface (Hero) that all hero classes implement. It outlines the basic structure and expected behaviors for each superhero.

Hero Classes – Multiple Java files named after popular heroes such as:

Spiderman.java

Ironman.java

Thor.java

Each hero class provides its own unique implementation of the Hero interface, showcasing polymorphism and encapsulation in Java.
